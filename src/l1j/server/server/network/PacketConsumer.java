 * (Tricid)  These are the packet consumers for the new network model.  They try to pull from a queue that contains
 * clients (not packets), blocking on the queue when it's empty.  Once they get a client it runs a client method that
 * processes any packets it may have.  That's a bit weird.
 *
 *  I didn't do a direct packet queue because:  I didn't want two+ consumers working on any one client at the same time;
 *  I also didn't want one client filling up the queue.  I have no idea if that was even necessary.  During further testing
 *  I might tweak how that works.
 *
 *  Additionally, if I ever get motivated in the future to implement my speed hack fix I've done on other servers, this is
 *  the model it relies on.  It'll make sense when/if I implement it for l1j
