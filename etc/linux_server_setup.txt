This document details setting up the server on a Linux, BSD, Solaris, 
or unix-variant OS. Currently, only Linux and BSD are in use within this 
team.

Setup
-----

TODO: Fill this in later. For now, see the project site's Server Setup
Guide wiki for a general overview.

Running
-------

First thing to do is make the dir "log" in your server dir.  Then you need to 
edit "l1server_startup.sh" to your server dir.  Then to use the shell files 
you need make "l1server_startup.sh" executable.  To do that you use command 
"chmod +x l1server_startup.sh" and do the same for serverstart.sh.  Then from 
the terminal you run 

./l1server_startup.sh 

Then your server should be up and running. To check if it is, look in your 
server folder and look in the dir "log" and read stdout.log.  It will show 
you your console info.
